### My Contribution

-Created EnhancedTree class as a wrapper for our base Tree that allowed us to make branch-specific actions such as addition and removal of nodes.

-Created Sign Up page.

-Created Profile page with functionality for switching among a selection of different trees (performed by selecting the tree name from a dropdown and clicking the switch button).

-Cleaned up the code by removing all now-unnecessary issue-related files from the project.
